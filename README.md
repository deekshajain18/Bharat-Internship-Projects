## House Price Prediction

### Description:
- Developed a machine learning model for predicting house prices using Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.
- Used Flask for creating a web application to interact with the model.
- Utilized Ridge regression for modeling.

### Files:
- `house_price_prediction.py`: Python script containing the machine learning model.
- `final_dataset.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `RidgeModel.pkl`: Pickled model file for deployment.

### Usage:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run `python house_price_prediction.py` to train the model.
4. Run `python app.py` to start the Flask web application.
5. Access the application at `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.

## Movie Recommendations

### Description:
- Built a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering and machine learning techniques in Python.
- Analyzed and processed the MovieLens dataset.
- Implemented collaborative filtering to recommend similar movies based on user ratings.

### Files:
- `movie_recommendations.py`: Python script containing the recommendation system.
- `m_id.tsv`: MovieLens dataset file.
- `Movie_Id_Titles.csv`: File containing movie titles mapped to their IDs.

### Usage:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run `python movie_recommendations.py` to generate movie recommendations.
4. Explore the recommendations and correlations between movies.
